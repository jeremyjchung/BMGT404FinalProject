Final project for University of Maryland BMGT404.

## What is Order Magic?

Order Magic is an application that allows carryout restaurants, such as D.P. Dough, to track customer orders, and send update texts to customers. This should eliminate the wait time for customers, because they will be informed in real time about the ETA of their order. We hope that this application will be one that can be generalized to all restaurants that have carryout services, and will improve the restuarant and customer carryout experience.

## Running the Application

To run the customer-side application, in which the customer sends an order to the restaurant, run ...

```
python CustomerOrder.py
```

To run the restaurant-side application, in which the restaurant tracks orders, run ...

```
python service.py
```

## System Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
